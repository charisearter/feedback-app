# Feedback App

A practice standalone section for a larger side-project I am building.
When complete, I will convert the project to TypeScript.

This will be the a more interactive component in the main project.

This tutorial is a bit outdated, so I am taking notes from it and refreshing myself on concepts. Then build my own project, using more updated tech.
